# WordleBot

Automatic wordle solver bot that uses a word bank of guessable words to solve the NYT game Wordle. 

8/31 Update: Working on Windows/MacOS version, Wordle API now has screenshot blocking features which renders pyautogui or Pillow useless for this. Currently trying to find a work-around.
